## Movie WatchList

A React application that fetches data from a movie database API. It dynamically renders information on most movies and tv series. This information is displayed on a modal, which prevents users from being taken to another page. As an added feature, you are able to add movies/tv shows to a watchlist, which is saved to local storage. Additionally, the app was styled using Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI.

## Lessons Learned

Although I have worked with external API’s before with JavaScript projects, this was a first with a React project. I had a lot of fun building this app and extracting movie data from JSON files. The project was also a refresher on using asynchronous JavaScript (async/await, fetch API), and I learned a lot about error handling.

Moreover, I used this project as an opportunity to use React Router into a project. Using Router was straightforward and its implementation made navigating to different links smooth.

I wasn’t content with the app only rendering movie data and I wanted to implement some usability. For this reason, I included a watch list route that displays movies that the user would like to watch at some point. The user can easily add or remove movies with the click of a button.

Styling was applied using Tailwind CSS for the apps structure & design, and Daisy UI for its theme & colour palette. This allowed me to focus on React concepts and applying functionality.

## Future Updates

• Include a search feature that filters displayed movies based on genres (action, adventure, fantasy etc). This could be in the form of a drop down menu placed next to the search bar.

• Add further information on movies such as duration, actors/actresses and a link to it’s trailer.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
